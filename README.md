# Trivia-No-Jutsu
## Why did I make this website?
I made this website to test my friends about anime.
I also made this website to show my knowledge about anime.
Another reason I made this website was to have fun and think about questions.
## What did I learn during this project?
- I learned about  propagation
- I learned about flexbox
- I learned about buttons
- I learned about grids as well.
## Something I wish I knew
Something I wish I knew was how to create a grid.
I also wish I knew how to rotate grid tiles.
Another thing I wish I knew was how to use stop propagation.
## My next project
My next project I plan on doing is make this trivia webiste editable so people can make all sorts of trivia not limited to anime.
I plan on doing this over the summer and looking at tutoirials.
I also plan on adding the ability to add a scoreboard so people can keep track of their teams score.
